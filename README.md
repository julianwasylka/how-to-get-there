### Program that takes as input a map made of ASCII characters and answers queries about finding a path

The 2nd project assigned in the Algorithms and Data Structures course during the second semester.
The inputs were quite large, so the program had to use efficient algorithms (Dijsktra, priority queue, hashmap), that I had to implement myself.

The use of most of the libraries was prohibited.
